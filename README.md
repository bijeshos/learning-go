# Learning Go
This repository contains programs and materials used for Go training

# How this repository is organized
Broadly, based on target audience, programs in this repository are categorized into levels as follows:

| Level | Target Audience | Assumptions |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Fundamentals | Learners who do not have any background in Go |Learners have some exposure to other programming langauages|
| Intermediate | Learners who have some understanding about Go |Learners are familiar with basic concepts in Go|
| Advanced | Learners who have good understanding about Go |Learners are familiar with Go and have written good amount of programs in Go|

A few additional points to note:

- Each level is furthur divided into various topics and examples. 
- Topics and examples within each topic is arranged in a sequential order. It is highly recommanded to follow the order as it appears. 
- Each example assumes that the learner has understanding about previous example/topic. 
- Each example program (*.go) can be executed in a standalone way
    - All of the example programs are part of `main` package and contains `main` function

*(Note: In a real life go project, only one program should contain `main` function. But, in this repository, each program contains a `main` function. This approach is followed indentionally to make it simple to execute the program. *This is not a recommanded practice for a real life project*.)*

At the moment, following are topics/exmples covered:

| Level | Topic | Examples |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| Fundamentals | Basics | <ul><li>Hello World</li><li>Package, Imports, Exports</li><li>Print</li></ul> |
| Fundamentals | Variables | <ul><li>Default variable values</li><li>Global variables</li><li>Variables with initializers</li><li>Short variable declarations</li></ul> |
| Fundamentals | Flow control | <ul><li>If</li><li>If/Else</li><li>If with a short statement</li><li>For loop</li><li>For as while</li><li>Switch</li><li>Defer</li></ul> |
| Fundamentals | Arrays | <ul><li>Basics</li></ul> |
