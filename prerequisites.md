# Prerequisites

Since the focus of this training is coding practice, it would be helpful to have the environment ready before the session starts. This guide will help you to get the environement setup. 


# Installation

*It is assumed that you have __admin rights__ to install software and set/modify environment variables in your machine*

## Go
First dependency we have is to install and configure __Go__ itself. 
- Follow the official instructions from [here](https://golang.org/doc/install) to download and install Go
- Ensure that relevant environment variables mentioned in the instructions are configured properly. 

## Visual Studio Code
The next dependency we have is to setup an IDE for the purpose of coding. For the purpose of our training, we'll be using Visual Studio Code.

- Download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install the same

In addition to the Visual Studio Code, we also need to configure Go Plugin. 

- Follow instructions from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Go) to install the plugin.

# Pre-read
Before the session starts, it would help to have some background about Go. Here is a set of useful URLs you could use to read before the session.
